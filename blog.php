<p>
	 This lesson already introduced you to a scenario in which you are in charge of designing novelty socks. With this activity, you will take that one step further and actually design several different possible garments and other textiles. Choose one or more of the options below and write a detailed plan for your design. Draw the pattern, choose the fabric, and consider what other factors might be important for your design.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>The Socks:</b>&nbsp;Design a pattern for your novelty socks! Look up some novelty socks that already exist and then try to come up with an original design. Draw a sketch of what your socks will look like. Who is your target audience? Why do you think they will choose your socks over any other option? Consider these questions while you work.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><b>Accessible Design:</b>&nbsp;One of the major factors that a textile designer has to consider is texture. Imagine you are working for a company that makes clothing for people with sensory processing disorder who need soft clothes without irritating seams or tight clasps. Design one or more garments with this audience in mind. Be as creative as you want with your design, and do extra research to learn more about the issues you are addressing. You can also choose another accessibility issue like restricted mobility or clothing designed for amputees.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><b>Interior Design:</b>&nbsp;Choose any textile that you can find in your home and redesign it. Think about what fabric will be best suited to the textile's purpose and design the color scheme so that it fits in with the rest of the decor in your home.</li>
